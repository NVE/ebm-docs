Limitations
============

Model functionality
-------------------

The model does not have functionality on: 

- Electrical vehicles
- Buildings used in power intensive industries
- Local energy production
- Power price
- Load profiles
- Cost optimization of heating systems
- Cost of energy efficiency 
- Single buildings
- Years prior to 2020


The NVE dataset
---------------

**Note! The current data on demolition and building of new area does not align with available statistics. 
Changes in building stock area and energy consumption should therefore be used with caution. 
An updated and improved dataset will be published along with the next version of the model.** 


Limitations in the current version of the official data and forecast of NVE include:

- "Norgespris" has not been taken into account in the current version 
- The impact of the ageing populations is not accounted for
- Rebound effects of energy efficiency measures are not included
- Public and private buildings are not defined

Development Setup
-----------------

To set up the project locally:

.. code:: shell

   git clone https://github.com/nve/Energibruksmodell.git
   cd Energibruksmodell
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate.ps1 on Windows


--------------

Code Style & Guidelines
-----------------------

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Keep pull requests focused and minimal
- Include docstrings and comments where helpful

--------------


Testing with Pytest
----------------------

We use pytest for testing. All new features and bug fixes should include
relevant tests.

Running Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the test suite:

.. code:: shell


   pytest tests/


Writing Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Place your tests in the ``tests/ebm`` directory.
- Name test files starting with ``test_``.
- Use descriptive names for test functions.
- Prefer fixtures for setup and teardown logic.

Example:

.. code:: python

   from ebm.model.scurve import SCurve

   def test_energy_calculation():
       s_curve = SCurve(earliest_age=5,
                        average_age=20,
                        rush_years=20,
                        last_age=50,
                        rush_share=0.8,
                        never_share=0.1)

       assert s_curve._calc_pre_rush_rate() == 0.01

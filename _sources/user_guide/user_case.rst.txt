User case
=========


This guide demonstrates how to create and configure a new scenario in EBM by introducing a hypothetical future building code: *TEK30*.
Scenario-based modeling in EBM allows users to explore alternative planning assumptions, regulatory changes, and energy performance impacts by managing separate input directories.

The TEK30 scenario showcases how to:
 - Create a dedicated input directory for scenario data
 - Define a new building code and its timeline
 - Specify energy needs across building categories
 - Configure heating system shares
 - Optionally adjust lighting improvements


Working with input
------------------

EBM supports scenario-based modeling by allowing users to create and manage separate input directories. This enables
flexible experimentation with different assumptions and configurations.


Creating an input directory for a scenario
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a new scenario in EBM, open your preferred terminal and run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   ebm --create-input --input=user-case-tek30


The input directory will be created path defined after `--input==`. In this case the files will be added to the
subdirectory `user-case-tek30`.
If the directory you name does not already exist, the program will attempt to create it. All input files necessary to run ebm will be created, with their default values, in the supplied path.


.. tip::

    You can choose any valid directory name, but it is a good idea to limit to letters, numbers, and underscore. Avoid using space.





Using the input directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the input directory is ready, you can run the model using:

.. code-block:: bash

   ebm --input=user-case-tek30

The model result as defined in with user-case-tek30 will be written to the subdirectory ``output``.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`Results <results>`


User case: Add a new building code
----------------------------------

This example demonstrates how to use EBM’s scenario functionality by adding a new building code. TEK30 represents
a hypothetical future building code introduced as part of a user case to demonstrate how EBM handles scenario-based
modeling.


To add TEK30 to ebm you will need to
 - :ref:`Add the new building code to the model in building_code_parameters.csv<add the new building code>`
 - :ref:`Define energy needs for TEK30 in energy_need_original_condition.csv<define energy needs for TEK30>`
 - :ref:`Specify heating system shares in heating_system_initial_shares.csv<Specify heating system shares>`


This process showcases how EBM can be extended to simulate future regulations or alternative planning assumptions.


Add the new building code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The timeline and classification of building codes used by EBM are defined in the csv file ``building_code_parameters.csv``.
To include TEK30 in your scenario, you must first define it in that file.

You can edit building_code_parameters.csv using a
plain text editor (e.g., Notepad) or spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc.


.. tip::

   When using spreadsheet software, ensure the correct formatting is preserved when saving as CSV.
    - Use comma ``,`` as the delimiter
    - Use full stop ``.`` as the decimal separator


.. Set the following values in building_code_parameters.csv:
     - building_code: TEK30
     - building_year: 2030
     - period_start_year: 2030
     - period_end_year: 2050

Add the following line to building_code_parameters.csv to define TEK30 as a new building code entry:

.. code-block:: text

   TEK30,2030,2030,2050


EBM does not allow overlapping periods in building_code_parameters.csv. Since TEK17 currently ends in 2050, we must adjust the end year for TEK17 as well:

 To avoid overlapping periods, update the TEK17 entry in ``building_code_parameters.csv`` as follows:

.. code-block:: text

   TEK17,2025,2020,2029


When done correctly ``building_code_parameters.csv`` should look like the example below.

Define energy needs for TEK30
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All building codes must have it's energy need defined in :ref:`energy_need_original_condition.csv<energy_need_original_condition>`. For this scenario we assume a TEK30 have a 2/3 energy need reduction for heating_rv and 1/4 reduction for heating_dhw, cooling, fans_and_pumps and electrical_equipment.

Similarly to TEK17, there is no need to add TEK30 to :ref:`area.csv<area>` as all the area in both TEKs will be built after the start year 2020.


Extra credit
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The input files :ref:`energy_need_improvements.csv<energy_need_improvements>`, :ref:`heating_system_forecast.csv<heating_system_forecast>`, :ref:`improvement_building_upgrade.csv<improvement_building_upgrade>` and :ref:`energy_need_behaviour_factor.csv<energy_need_behaviour_factor>`
have defined default values under the column building_code that will apply to TEK30. For extra credit you may override the defaults with your own values.


energy need improvements
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Optionally, you can add a line to :ref:`energy_need_improvements.csv<energy_need_improvements>` if you think that there is no yearly reduction lighting with TEK30 .

.. code-block:: csv

   default,TEK30,lighting,yearly_reduction,2031,0.0,2050

energy need behaviour factor
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In :ref:`energy_need_behaviour_factor.csv<energy_need_behaviour_factor>` add TEK30 to the house row's building_code column:

This row:

.. code-block::

   house,TEK07+TEK10+TEK17,lighting,0.85,2020,noop,2050

Becomes:

.. code-block::

   house,TEK07+TEK10+TEK17+TEK30,lighting,0.85,2020,noop,2050

energy_need_original_condition
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

While the default values for lighting in `energy_need_original_condition.csv<energy_need_original_condition>` are handy for editing, you might want to set explicit values for TEK30.

User case
=========


This guide demonstrates how to create and configure a new scenario in EBM by introducing a hypothetical future building code: *TEK30*.
Scenario-based modeling in EBM allows users to explore alternative planning assumptions, regulatory changes, and energy performance impacts by managing separate input directories.

The TEK30 scenario showcases how to:
 - Create a dedicated input directory for scenario data
 - Define a new building code and its timeline
 - Specify energy need across building categories
 - Configure heating system shares
 - Optionally adjust lighting improvements


Working with input
------------------

EBM supports scenario-based modeling by allowing users to create and manage separate input directories. This enables
flexible experimentation with different assumptions and configurations.


Creating an input directory for a scenario
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a new scenario in EBM, open your preferred terminal and run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   ebm --create-input --input=user-case-tek30


The input directory will be created using the path defined by the ``--input`` option. In this case the new input files will be
created as the subdirectory |user_case_tek30| in the current working directory.

If the directory you name does not exist, the program will attempt to create it. All input files necessary to run ebm
will be created, with their default values, in the supplied path.


.. tip::

    You can choose any valid directory name, but it is a good idea to limit to letters, numbers, and underscore. Avoid using space.


Using the input directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the input directory is ready, you can run the model using:

.. code-block:: bash

   ebm --input=user-case-tek30

The model result as defined in |user_case_tek30| will be written to the subdirectory |output_directory|.

   :ref:`Results<result files>`


User case: Add a new building code
----------------------------------

This example demonstrates how to use ``EBM`` scenario functionality by adding a new building code. TEK30 represents
a hypothetical future building code introduced as part of a user case to demonstrate how EBM handles scenario-based
modeling.


To add TEK30 to ebm you have to edit a number of files in the subdirectory |user_case_tek30|
 - Add the new building code to the model in |building_code_parameters_ref|
 - Define energy need for TEK30 in |energy_need_original_condition_ref|
 - Specify heating system shares in |heating_system_initial_shares_ref|


This process showcases how EBM can be extended to simulate future regulations or alternative planning assumptions.


Add the new building code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The timeline and classification of building codes used by EBM are defined in the csv file |building_code_parameters_ref| in  |user_case_tek30|.
To include TEK30 in your scenario, you must first define it in that file.

You can edit |building_code_parameters_ref| using a
plain text editor (e.g., Notepad) or spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc.


.. tip::

   When using spreadsheet software, ensure the correct formatting is preserved when saving as CSV.
    - Use comma ``,`` as the delimiter
    - Use full stop ``.`` as the decimal separator


.. Set the following values in building_code_parameters.csv:
     - building_code: TEK30
     - building_year: 2040
     - period_start_year: 2030
     - period_end_year: 2050



Add the following line to |building_code_parameters_ref| in  |user_case_tek30| to define TEK30 as a new building code entry:

.. code-block:: text

   TEK30,2040,2030,2050

The comma-separated columns in the line you added represent the following: building code, building year (in relation to S-curves),
start year for the building code, and end year for the building code. Both the start and end years are inclusive.


.. seealso::

   Other -> building_code under :ref:`input constraints`


EBM does not allow overlapping periods in |building_code_parameters_ref|. Since TEK17 currently ends in 2050, we must adjust the end year for TEK17 as well:

 To avoid overlapping periods, update the TEK17 entry in |building_code_parameters_ref| as follows:

.. code-block:: text

   TEK17,2025,2020,2029


When done correctly |building_code_parameters_ref| in  |user_case_tek30| should look like the example below.

Define energy need for TEK30
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All building codes must have it's energy need defined by |energy_need_original_condition_ref| in |user_case_tek30|. For this scenario we assume a TEK30 have a 2/3 energy need reduction for heating_rv and 1/4 reduction for heating_dhw, cooling, fans_and_pumps and electrical_equipment.

Similarly to TEK17, there is no need to add TEK30 to |area_ref| in |user_case_tek30| as all the area in both
TEKs will be built after the start year 2020.


Re-run the model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have adapted |building_code_parameters_ref|, |energy_need_original_condition_ref| and |heating_system_initial_shares_ref| to TEK30, you cat re-run the model.

.. code-block:: powershell

   ebm --input=user-case-tek30

The model results can be found in the subdirectory named |output_directory|.

.. tip::

   You can have ebm open the results as they are written by using the ``--open`` option

   .. code-block:: powershell

      ebm --input=user-case-tek30 --open


Extra credit
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The input files |energy_need_improvements_ref|, |heating_system_forecast_ref|, |improvement_building_upgrade_ref| and |energy_need_behaviour_factor_ref|
have defined default values under the column building_code that will apply to TEK30. For extra credit you may override the defaults with your own values.


energy need improvements
""""""""""""""""""""""""

In ``EBM`` there is a 0.5% yearly reduction in energy need for defined the building category house defined in
|energy_need_improvements_ref| in |user_case_tek30|. Since TEK30 is a new code from TEK30 one can
assume that no such reduction will happen due to the fact that the reduction will already be define in the building
code.

You can add a line to |energy_need_improvements_ref| in |user_case_tek30| if you think that there is no yearly reduction lighting with TEK30.

.. code-block:: text

   default,TEK30,lighting,yearly_reduction,2031,0.0,2050


energy_need_original_condition
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This file sets baseline lighting energy need (kWh/m¬≤) for different building types and codes used in the ``EBM`` model.

**default values**

.. csv-table:: energy_need_original_condition.csv where purpose is lighting
   :header: building_category,building_code,purpose,kwh_m2

    house,default,lighting,8.2
    apartment_block,default,lighting,8.2
    retail,default,lighting,50.2
    office,default,lighting,22.55
    kindergarten,default,lighting,18.79
    school,default,lighting,19.35

    sports,default,lighting,18.58
    culture,default,lighting,20.67
    storage_repairs,default,lighting,16.91

By default, all building codes have the same energy need for lighting per square metre. As an illustration on how one
can redefine energy need we will modify the file |energy_need_original_condition_ref| in |user_case_tek30|.

If you open the file |energy_need_original_condition_ref| in |user_case_tek30| with a spreadsheet application or text editor,
you'll see that all building categories with lighting as their purpose use the building code "default."
This default value acts as a catch-all, telling ``EBM`` to apply the specified kWh/m¬≤
value for lighting unless a more specific definition is provided.

.. csv-table:: Example energy_need_original_condition.csv
   :header: building_category,building_code,purpose,kwh_m2

    apartment_block,default,lighting,8.2
    house,default,lighting,8.2
    house,TEK17,lighting,5.0
    house,TEK10,lighting,6.2


**In this example**:

- All **apartment_block** buildings, regardless of code, use **8.2 kWh/m¬≤** for lighting.
- **House** buildings also default to **8.2 kWh/m¬≤**, except:

  - Houses with **TEK10** use **6.2 kWh/m¬≤**
  - Houses with **TEK17** use **5.0 kWh/m¬≤**



**Defining explicit lighting for TEK30**

While the default values for lighting defined by |energy_need_original_condition_ref| in  |user_case_tek30| are
handy for editing, you might want to set explicit values for TEK30 so that you can define specific values. Let's imagine
that the energy need for lighting with TEK30 is half of what earlier building code standards required.

**Defining common lighting for TEK17 and TEK30**

To simplify energy need definitions across building codes, you can combine TEK17 and TEK30 using the *+* symbol. This
approach allows you to assign a shared lighting energy value to multiple building codes for the same building category.

You can also combine building categories in the same way. This is especially useful when several categories or codes
share identical lighting requirements, helping reduce duplication and streamline your definitions.

The example below demonstrates how to group both building codes and building categories that share the same lighting
energy need values.


.. csv-table:: Excerpt TEK30+TEK17 lighting energy_need_original_condition.csv
   :header: building_category,building_code,purpose,kwh_m2

energy need behaviour factor
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In |energy_need_behaviour_factor_ref| in |user_case_tek30| there is a specific value set
for behaviour factor for TEK07, TEK10 and TEK17. It is sensible to add the new building code TEK30 to the file
building_code column:

This row:

.. code-block::

   house,TEK07+TEK10+TEK17,lighting,0.85,2020,2050

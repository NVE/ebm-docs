Energy use
###########

Energy use is the product of energy need, area and heating systems.

Each heating technology (e.g. wood stove or electrical panel heater) use one energy carrier (e.g. wood or electricity). Knowing the 
composition of heating solutions, their efficiencies and which energy product they use, means that the model can forecast the use of 
different energy products. The energy products included in the model are electricity, fuel wood, district heating and fossil fuel.

The formula for **Total energy use per year** in the EBM (Energibruksmodell) is designed for annual energy use of the building mass. The calculation takes into account the type of energy product and efficiency in heating systems.

.. math::

   \text{energy use kWh}_{\text{year}} =
      \frac{
        \text{energy need kWh/m}^{\text{2}}_{\text{year}}
        \times
        \text{area m}^{\text{2}}_{\text{year}}
        \times \text{heating systems share}_{\text{year}}
      }{
        \text{heating systems efficiency kWh/kWh}
      }


Explanation of Each Factor
--------------------------

 * **energy need kWh/m²**
   - :ref:`Energy need` for the building type, building condition and purpose.
 * **area m²**
   - :ref:`area` for building type and condition
 * **heating systems share**
   - Distribution of :ref:`heating systems <Aggregating the heating systems>` across the building stock
 * **heating systems efficiency**
   - Thermal efficiency of heating systems

Energy use per year can be broken down into energy use per purpose and energy product across building categories and building codes.

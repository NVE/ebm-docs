Energy need
###########

Energy need in the model is determined by many factors; Building category, age and how much the area has been renovated. 
The base line energy need per square metre is defined in the building code. Each :ref:`building category <building category and building code>` has a specific energy need according
to its building code, building condition and :ref:`energy purpose <energy purpose>`.
The energy condition of the area in the model changes between the model years due to renovation and small measures. 
An user defined S- curve determines how often and how much the area undergoes renovation and small measures. 
The area in the model can have on of the following conditions: 

* Original condition
* Small measure
* Renovation
* Renovation and small measure

In addition the energy need can be distributed on different energy purposes. 
By default the energy need in the model is distributed on these energy purposes: 

* heating the building
* heating domestic hot water
* lighting
* appliances
* fans and pumps 
* cooling

The formula for **energy need per square metre per year** in the EBM (Energibruksmodell) is designed to estimate how much
energy a building requires annually, adjusted for various factors.

.. math::

   \begin{align}
   \text{energy need kWh/m}^{\text{2}}_{\text{year}} &= \text{energy need original condition}_{\text{building code}} \\
   &\times \text{improvement building upgrade}_{\text{building condition}} \\
   &\times \left(1.0 - \text{yearly reduction}\right)^{\text{year} - \text{start year}} \\
   &\times \text{improvement end year}_{\text{year}} \\
   &\times \text{behaviour factor} \\
   \end{align}


Explanation of Each Factor
--------------------------

 * **Energy need original condition**
   - Baseline energy use for the building type and purpose as defined by the building code.

 * **improvement building upgrade**
   - Accounts for renovations or upgrades that improve energy performance. By default this will be small measure, renovation or both.

 * **Yearly reduction**
   - Annual percentage reduction in energy use due to technological progress or behavioral changes.

 * **Improvement end year factor**
   - A modifier that adjusts the reduction effect with improvements expected to be finalized after a certain year. EU Commission’s RoHS directive, banning fluorescent lamps, is an example of policy that can be modelled using this factor.

 * **Behaviour factor**
   - Captures changes in user behavior that affect energy consumption, like floor area utilization.





Energy purpose
--------------

Energy purpose is used to define level of energy, its source, and assess whether any energy-saving measures are applied.

There are six energy purposes defined in EBM.


Heating Room Ventilation (heating_rv)
    Energy used for space heating in rooms, typically through radiators, underfloor heating, or air systems. This includes the energy required to maintain indoor temperatures at comfortable levels during colder periods.

Heating Domestic Hot Water (heating_dhw)
    Energy used to heat water for domestic purposes such as bathing, cooking, and cleaning. This is separate from space heating and is often supplied by boilers, heat pumps, or electric water heaters.

Fans and pumps
    Electricity consumed by mechanical systems that circulate air or fluids within a building. This includes HVAC fans, circulation pumps for heating and cooling systems, and booster pumps for water supply.

Lighting
    Electricity used for indoor and outdoor lighting, including general illumination, task lighting, and emergency lighting systems. This category often includes both traditional and energy-efficient lighting technologies.

Electrical equipment
    Energy consumed by plug-in devices and fixed electrical systems not covered by other categories. This includes computers, kitchen appliances, office equipment, elevators, and other miscellaneous electrical loads.

Cooling
    Energy used for air conditioning and refrigeration systems to maintain comfortable indoor temperatures and preserve perishable goods. This includes chillers, split systems, and centralized cooling systems.


Below is an excerpt showing the kilowatt hours per square metre for retail buildings, categorized by energy purpose according to the TEK07 building code:

Renovation and small measures 
-----------------------------

The rates for implementing small measures and renovation are determined. The rates are
set in relation to the area's age, and a development comparable to an S-curve is expected. The rates can be defined 
individually for each building category. The proportion of a building type that is
demolished, renovated, and undergoes small measures each year will therefore depend on the age distribution of the building stock
for that building type.

It is not uncommon for buildings that have reached a certain age to have undergone both small measures and renovation. This is
accounted for in the model. However, this version of the model does not allow small measures and renovation to be done several times on the same building. 
This is something that we plan to improve in coming versions of the model. 

An example of how the renovation rates can function in the model: 
Let's look at the small measure rate for office buildings. In the first few years after the
buildings are constructed, no small measures are implemented. When the buildings are three years old, small measures will 
be implemented on some of the buildings. Small measures will be implemented in 1.4 % of the relevant office area each year 
until the buildings are ten years old. At ten years of age, the pace of implementing small measures increases, and 4 % of the 
area undergoes small measures each year. This high rate continues until the building stock is 30 years old. From then on,
only 0.5 % of the building stock will undergo small measures annually. It is assumed that 1 % of the area
will never have small measures implemented, and that the buildings that are to have small measures implemented will have had 
them done within 50 years.

Building category and building code
===================================

The tables below shows the different building categories and building codes (TEK) which are used in the model. The building category table shows what other types of buildings
are included under the main building category. The building
categories are the same as defined in the building code with the exception of "light industry and repairs". From this category the model
only uses the area attributed to storage and warehouses, and the category is then named "storage".

EBM Documentation
=============================

EBM is a model used by the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorates (NVE) to forecast energy use in the building stock. 
EBM is a bottom-up model that estimates how area, energy need, heating systems and energy use in the building stock changes over time. 
The model is developed in-house by the Norwegian Water Resources- and Energy Directorate (NVE). 
It is an open-source model, with an accompanying dataset developed by NVE. 

This website provides documentation on how to use EBM, how the model works and a description of the dataset. To read more about how NVE work with models, visit https://www.nve.no/.

EBM Documentation
=============================
EBM is a bottom-up model that estimates how area, energy need, heating systems and energy use in the building stock changes over time. 
The model is developed in-house by the Norwegian Water Resources- and Energy Directorate (NVE). It is an open source model, with an accompanying dataset developed by NVE.   
On this website you will find information on how to use the model and an overview of the model architecture and functionality. 
In addition a description of the dataset and assumptions is provided.

EBM Documentation
=================

EBM is a model used by the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorates (NVE) to forecast energy use in the building stock. 
EBM is a bottom-up model that estimates how area, energy need, heating systems and energy use in the building stock changes over time. 
The model is developed in-house by the Norwegian Water Resources- and Energy Directorate (NVE). 
It is an open-source model, with an accompanying dataset developed by NVE.

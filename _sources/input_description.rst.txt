Use of "default" and grouping
===================================
When making changes to an input file, for example **energy_need_improvements**, you can use aggregated 
commands instead of specifying each individual *building category*, *building code* and *purpose*. The common aggregated
command is **default**. When **default** is input the model chooses all valid options. For example **default** 
building code means all building codes. 

*Building category* has two additional groups: **residential** and
**non-residental** where **residential** consists of houses and apartment blocks, and **non-residential** are the other
building groups. In the input constraint overview these aggregated groups are specified when available.

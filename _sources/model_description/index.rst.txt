Model Description
#################

EBM is a bottom-up model that estimates how area, energy need and energy use in the building stock changes over time. 
The start year of the model consist of user input about the building stock area, 
its condition and how it is divided between different building categories and building codes. 
Information about the use of heating systems and their efficiencies in the start year must also be provided. 
When forecasting how the building stock changes over time, the model consider changes in 

* population and demographics
* demolition and construction of buildings
* energy efficiency measures
* heating systems 

The main result of the model is annual energy use for each building category, building code, energy purpose and energy product. 
The annual energy use can be distributed geographically as defined by the user.

The main steps of the model
===========================


For each building category and year in the model the calculations consist of four main steps:

#. Determine rates for
    a. Implementation of small energy efficiency measures (called small measures)
    b. Renovation
    c. Demolition
    d. New construction
#. Forecast area development, with area distributed by condition, i.e., whether the area is in original condition or has undergone small measures or renovation or both.
#. Link area to relevant energy need allocated by energy purpose.
#. Assign heating system to the area to determine the use of electricity, district heating, wood and natural gas.

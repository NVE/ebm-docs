<p>Heating systems is the link from the computed <em>energy need</em> to <em>energy use</em>. <em>Energy need</em> states what the building requires in
terms of space heating, non-substitutable electrical use and hot tap water. Heating systems assigns specific heating technologies to meet the energy
demand of space heating and hot tap water. Various heating technologies have different efficiencies and energy products which then gives an <em>energy use</em>.</p>
<p>A combination of different heating systems can be assigned to each building category and each age group. It is also possible to do it on
an aggregated level, like treating all non-residental area the same way. For instance, X % of the house area use only direct resistance heating to heat the home, while Y % of the house area
use both direct resistance heating, an air-to-air heat pump and a wood stove, and so on. The composition of heating solutions can be changed
over time in the forecast period.</p>
<p>The input to EBM is aggregated heating system shares for houses, apartment blocks and non-residental buildings. The source of the intial shares is the
Norwegian energy performance building database which has been processed outside of EBM and described under assumptions. As part of the processing the
energy useage per product and building category is compared with the  national energy balance to fine tune
the distribution of the various heating technologies. The process is described under “methods” and “assumptions” and an overview is shown in the flowchart below.</p>

<section id="selecting-certificates">
<h3>Selecting certificates<a class="headerlink" href="#selecting-certificates" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The initial heating system shares are based on the Norwegian energy building performance database. The database contains information on the energy class
of certified buildings. There are 1,2 million certificates in total spread out among the 13 building categories, however for some categories, especially
non-residental buildings, the number of certificates are low. Some cleaning is done on the dataset to filter out misleading certificates and duplicates.
The cleaning steps done are the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Removed certificates missing building category, heated floor area or energy performance label</p></li>
<li><p>Removed certificates where calculated delivered energy is above 1000 kWh/m <sup>2</sup>.</p></li>
<li><p>If a certificate has been issued to the same address more than once, the most recent certificate is kept. This is done for all building categories except for apartment blocks or hospitals as one address can contain multiple buildings or apartments. For apartments the house number is often missing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After these three steps there are about 1 million certificates remaining. The associated building code classification is added to the certificates based on the supplied
building year.</p>
</section>
<section id="determining-heating-systems">
<h3>Determining heating systems<a class="headerlink" href="#determining-heating-systems" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The certificates has a column for “heating system”. This column can vary from one or more energy products or a combination of various technologies.
About 130 000 certificates do not have this information. For certificates missing this information an estimate is done based on the combination of
“delivered energy”. For example if the certificate has values for “bio” and “electricity” the heating system is set to
“Electricity - Bio”. This results in 190 different heating systems which is then aggregated to 12 categories shown in the table below, together with the
corresponding technology for the different loads and hot tap water.</p>
</section>
<section id="calculating-the-heating-system-share">
<h3>Calculating the heating system share<a class="headerlink" href="#calculating-the-heating-system-share" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The share of each heating system for a given combination is the useful area summed up per heating system, building category and building code and then
divided by the total useful area of the given building category and building code. The useful area is part of the energy certificates. This can be written as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\text{heating system share} = \frac{\sum^n_{area_{hs}}}{\sum^k_{area_{bc}}}\]</div>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>area</em> in this context is the useful area given by the energy performance certificates.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> is the number of certificates in the respective group.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(area_{hs}\)</span> is the useful area for a given group of heating system, building category and building code. For example: <em>Electricity - Bio, House, TEK49</em></p></li>

<section id="manual-tuning-of-heating-systems">
<h3>Manual tuning of heating systems<a class="headerlink" href="#manual-tuning-of-heating-systems" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The described process gives a good starting point on the distribution of heating systems, but manual tuning is needed. The manual tuning on heating systems is done
to roughly hit the energy use from statistics before calibration. Manual tuning is done by shifting a percentage
of a heating system to another on a per building and TEK basis. An example is given below which shifts 45 % of the district heating technology share
into Heat pump central heating and electric boilers for apartment blocks in TEK07, TEK10 and TEK17.</p>

<section id="aggregating-the-heating-systems">
<h3>Aggregating the heating systems<a class="headerlink" href="#aggregating-the-heating-systems" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The building energy performance database gives us information on heating systems across the various building codes and categories. However for some building categories,
especially for newer building codes, the amount of certificates are too few to give a good representation of that particular building code and category. In addition the
energy balance is reported on “residential” and “non-residential” buildings without any other details such as building code or
specific building type. To get a good point of comparison we therefore aggregate the heating systems to three categories per building code based on the useful area in EBM:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>House</p></li>
<li><p>Apartment block</p></li>
<li><p>Non-residential buildings</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is assumed that the different building conditions have the same heating systems under a given building code for aggregation purposes.
Finally the share of heating systems is aggreagted up to
the three building categories. The new aggregated heating systems are then set for all the building codes in the three building categories.
This means that a TEK69 house has the same share heating systems as a TEK17 house, and a TEK69 kindergarten has the same share of heating systems as a TEK10 office.
The resulting heating systems are then used as an input to EBM. An example on the aggreagted heating systems is given below for houses.</p>
<p>A final tuning of the heating systems are done in the calibration step of the model. For more information on calibration see <a class="reference internal" href="../user_guide/calibrating_the_model.html#calibrating-the-model"><span class="std std-ref">Calibrating the model</span></a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="heating-systems-efficiencies">
<h3>Heating systems efficiencies<a class="headerlink" href="#heating-systems-efficiencies" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Each heating technology is either a base load, peak load, tertiary load or hot water, making up the combined heating system. The
different heating technologies have an assosicated efficency factor, load share factor and energy product.
The efficiency factor, together with the related energy product, is used to get <em>energy use</em> per energy product
from <em>energy need</em>. For example, given that the energy need is only covered by the specific technology:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Air-air heat pumps have an efficiency factor of 2,5 with electricity as an energy product.
If the energy need for space heating is 1000 kWh, then the energy use is 400 kWh of electricity.</p></li>
<li><p>Wood fired stoves have an efficency factor of 0,65 with bio as an energy product.
If the energy need for space heating is 1000 kWh, then the energy use is 1538 kWh of bio.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The load share factor decides how much of the heating need is covered by a specific technology. A single air-air heat
pump can not provide heating to the whole building, and in addtion needs supplementation from another heating technology at
extreme temperatures. The current efficiencies and coverage factors are assumptions made by NVE.</p>
<p>All the combinations can be found in the <a class="reference internal" href="#tables-and-glossary"><span class="std std-ref">Tables and glossary</span></a> subchapter.</p>
</section>
<section id="forecasting">
<h3>Forecasting<a class="headerlink" href="#forecasting" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The current implementation and numbers of forecasting heating systems is based on various assumptions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Natural gas is phased out as a heating system for buildings by 2030.</p></li>
<li><p>Continued growth of air-air heat pumps in houses.</p></li>
<li><p>Increase in water-borne heating in new apartment blocks and non-residential buildings from building code requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>Increase in electric boilers and central heating heat pumps due to more water-borne heating.</p></li>
<li><p>Distrcit heating will increase in both non-residental buildings and in apartment blocks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The current implementation of forecasting for energy systems is simplified, meaning it is not based on an economic optimization model such as <a class="reference external" href="https://iea-etsap.org/index.php/etsap-tools/model-generators/times">TIMES</a>.</p>

<h3>Forecasting of heating systems<a class="headerlink" href="#forecasting-of-heating-systems" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Forecasting of heating systems are necessary to go from <em>energy need</em> to <em>energy use</em>.
The forecasting defines the rate of change in one heating system to another towards 2050. The change is done on a percentage basis compared with the start
year and can be specified on building category and building code. The percentage changes are given in the input file “heating_systems_forecasting”.
An example of the input is given in the table below. In the input file there are percentages for every year and not just the few years given as an example.
The rate of change is a way to look at the heating systems of the whole building mass as it includes both
retrofits and new construction. I.e it is not feasible for an exisiting apartment block to switch over
to distrcit heating, but a house retrofitting an air-air heat pump is possible.</p>
<p>From the first row it states that in 2024 10 % of the heating system “Gas” in non-residental buidlings changes to
the heating system “HP Central heating - Electric boiler”. If the heating system share of “Gas” was 5 % in 2023 and
“HP Central heating - Electric boiler” was 10 % for non-residental buildings, then the shares in
2024 are 4,5 % “Gas” and 10,5 % “HP Central heating - Electric boiler”. As 10 % of 5 % has changed from one heating system
to another, as per the table.</p>
<p>An example on how the forecasted heating systems are shown in the figure below. Here the share of air-air heatpumps is increased over time by shrinking
the share of “Electriciy - Bio” and increasing the share of “HP - Electricty - Bio”.</p>

<section id="making-changes-to-heating-systems">
<h3>Making changes to heating systems<a class="headerlink" href="#making-changes-to-heating-systems" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The easiest way to change the initial shares of heating systems is through <em>Kalibreringsark.xlsx</em> as part of the calibration process described here <a class="reference internal" href="../user_guide/calibrating_the_model.html#calibrating-the-model"><span class="std std-ref">Calibrating the model</span></a>.
The input file <em>heating_system_initial_shares.csv</em> remains unchanged with this method. It is possible to change the heating systems share in the input file.
All combinations of building code and building category are given their own heating systems share, but the shares themselves are indentical for each respesctive
building category of house, apartment block and non-residental building.</p>
<p>Making changes to the efficiency, energy product or utilisation factor can be done for each of the 12 combinations of heating systems in the input
file <em>heating_system_efficiencies.csv</em>. An overview of the heating system combinations can be found in the <a class="reference internal" href="#tables-and-glossary"><span class="std std-ref">Tables and glossary</span></a> subchapter.</p>
